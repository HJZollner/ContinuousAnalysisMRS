# Main automation script

## DICOMSORT arguments

The main script calls the `dicomsort` function that inspects the newly added folders for DICOM files and sorts them into suitably named folders. This step helps the BIDScoin heuristics with the BIDS conversion.

Depending on the DICOM header information, there might be a need to tailor the `dicomsort`command.

For example, our GE DICOM test data lacked the DICOM tag `SeriesDescription` that is, by default, used to determine the output folder name for `dicomsort`. We could override it by using the field `ScanningSeries`. 

In the main script, we replaced

```
script  = 'dicomsort {}'.format(subdir) # Script to Call
```

with

```
script  = 'dicomsort -f '{ScanningSeries}' {}'.format(subdir) # Script to Call
```
Here, we added `-f {ScanningSeries}` to tell `dicomsort` that it should use this tag to name the output folder.
